                <p>I finally was able to work out hosting this website. What I did was buy the domain from godaddy, then got a small $5 droplet from DigitalOcean, created NGINX config for hosting the site, then dockerized the nginx, and ran the docker container on the droplet. The next thing to do is to set up a Jenkins pipeline to automatically deploy my website changes to the droplet.</p>
                <p>In other news, I'm still trying to relearn Spanish. I "learned" Spanish for 6 years in high school but I didn't really learn it, I just coasted. I regret that now because as I've gotten a bit older I've realized there is a hell of a lot more to the world than just the parts that speak English.</p>
                <p>I travelled to Mexico not that long ago and tried dusting off my Spanish but I was pathetic. I could say basic things and I was able to ask a maintenance woman at the resort who didn't speak English for trash bags, but when it comes to conversation I get lost. Listening is definitely the most difficult part for me. So, I'm practicing speaking / reading out loud and listening as well, with the hope that I will one day be able to hold a conversation with a native speaker. I don't need to be perfect but I want to be able to comfortably converse in the language.</p>
                <p>I'm also on week 3... or maybe 4, of a bulk. I hadn't been able to go to the gym for the entire summer. So now that I've moved into my apartment and I have a gym membership again I'm tracking calories and bulking for the winter. I am slowly going up in weights, focusing heavily on form so as to not repeat past mistakes in the gym and get myself hurt.</p>

                <p>This is my first blog entry for my personal website. Writing plain HTML and CSS is very relaxing. I still need to figure out where to host this site. Considering its just a static HTML page, maybe I can find some free options.</p>
