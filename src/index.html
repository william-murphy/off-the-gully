                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Will Murphy. Welcome to my website. I'm from Massachusetts. My occupation is a software engineer, which means I enjoy computer programming and other technical things, but that isn't all that I do. The purpose of this website is to keep a portfolio of tech projects I'm working on, as well as a journal of whatever else, like bucket lists, reviews, ramblings, life updates, whatever. I enjoy TV, movies, games, music, language, sports, exercise, investing, and maybe more stuff in the future. This website's domain - <a href="/">offthegully.com</a> - is an homage to Minot beach in Scituate, MA, where I spent a lot of time as a kid. There is a tall rock on the shore of the beach that you can climb and jump off into the ocean. There are a few spots where you can jump off this rock, but the main spot is called the gully, where there is a small inlet of the ocean with tall rocks on three sides and the open ocean on the other. All of the opinions expressed on this website are mine and mine alone. If you want to contact me about anything, my email is below.</p>
