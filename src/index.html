                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Will Murphy. Welcome to my website. I'm from Massachusetts. My occupation is a software engineer, which means I enjoy computer programming and other technical things, but that isn't all that I do. The purpose of this website is to showcase some of the tech related things I've done and also to keep a journal of whatever I feel like writing about. I enjoy TV, movies, games, music, language, sports, exercise, investing, and maybe more stuff in the future. The picture to the right is me, with my shirt buttoned up way too high, but it's the most professional-looking picture I have of myself. I don't think of this website as strictly a portfolio, although that is certainly part of it, but rather a small corner of the internet where I can put things that I like. That could be bucket lists, reviews, ramblings, life updates, whatever. All of the opinions expressed on this website are mine and mine alone. If you want to contact me about anything, my email is below.</p>
